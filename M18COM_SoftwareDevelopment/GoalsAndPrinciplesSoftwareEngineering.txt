Identify and discuss an appropriate set of software engineering goals and principles that are appropriate for the development of a modern software system with your reasons.

Goals of the software
 	modifiability -
	efficiency -
	reliability - Test driven development
	understandability - 
	re-usability -

Principles
	modularity - independent parts, "Modularity is not . . . simply the arbitrary division of a large program into smaller parts or modules.
	abstraction - The essence of abstraction is to extract essential properties while omitting inessential details
	hiding - The purpose ofhiding is similar to that of abstraction in that it requires making visible only those properties of a module needed to interface with other modules.
	localization - The principle of localization is concerned with physical proximity. Things must be brought together all in one place. Thus, localization deals with physical interfaces, textual sequence, memory, etc
	uniformity - the lack of inconsistencies and unnecessary differences
 	completeness - The purpose of this principle is to ensure that all the essentials of an abstraction, for example, are explicit and that nothing essential has been omitted
	confirmability -   Confirmability is a principle that directs attention to methods for finding out whether stated goals have been achieved.

fundamental process.
 	(1) crystallize a purpose or objective; - define
	(2) formulate a concept for how the purpose can be achieved; - design
	(3) devise a mechanism that implements the conceptual structure; - execute
	(4) introduce a notation for expressing the capabilities of the mechanism and invoking its use; 
	(5) describe the usage of the notation in a specific problem context to invoke the mechanism so the purpose isachieved.
